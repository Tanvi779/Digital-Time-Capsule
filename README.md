# Digital Time Capsule – **For the Future You (Or the Future of Your Friends)** 🕰️✨

### **Overview** 🚀

A time capsule app that lets users write messages and unlock them at a chosen future date.

With the **Digital Time Capsule**, you can:

* Create messages that unlock at a chosen future date.
* Store text and images securely using Firebase.
* Revisit past thoughts once their unlock time has passed.
* Experience a playful “message from the past” effect — no paradoxes required.

---

### **How It Works** 💻

1. **You Write Your Message**
   Type your deeply thoughtful, or completely random, message to your future self. Maybe you’ll ask yourself, “What was I thinking?” or “How do I still not know how to cook pasta?”

2. **Set Your Unlock Time**
   Pick when you want the message to appear. It could be a year, a decade, or 2045 (because let’s be real, no one’s going to remember to open it until then).

3. **Add Media**
   Include photos. Maybe a dance challenge? A prophecy about the future? A clip of your dog stealing your lunch? You decide.

4. **Sign in with Google**
   (Or don’t — we’re not judging.) Sign in like a responsible adult, or wing it like a time-traveling rebel. ⏳

5. **Activate Dark Mode**
   For maximum future vibes. Dark mode is for people who want to look like they’re working late or living in a dystopian future. It’s basically a time capsule for your eyes.

### **Technologies Used** 🔧

### **Key Features** 🎉

1. **Future Self?**
   Write messages for *yourself*. Or, if you’re feeling generous, write messages intended for a friend and share them later (emotionally risky, but brave).

2. **Set a Time to Unlock**
   Pick any date. Imagine rediscovering a message on your birthday… or during a full-blown “what is life?” phase.

3. **Upload Images**
   Perfect for preserving memories, embarrassing moments, or proof that you once had a solid fashion sense (questionable).

4. **Google Sign-In**
   Because signing in with Google makes everything feel more official. ☑️

5. **Dark Mode**
   For when you want secret-agent energy but are really just reminding yourself how to fold a fitted sheet.

### **Getting Started** 🚀

1. Clone this repo and try not to mess anything up. (Kidding — you probably won’t.)
2. Open it in your browser and let the time-traveling magic begin.
3. If anything breaks, blame it on *time dilation*. That’s science.

### **Roadmap** 🛤️

* **Phase 1**: Make it work (done!).
* **Phase 2**: Messages to your past self (results may be confusing).
* **Phase 3**: A “message to your future dog” feature. 🐶
* **Phase 4**: Build a time machine (stretch goal).

### **Final Thoughts** 🧠

This app is *whimsical*, *useful*, and only slightly a waste of time. It’s a fun experiment in locking away thoughts, memories, and mild chaos for future-you to rediscover.

So go ahead — write your future self a note.
It’s like sending a postcard to tomorrow… with more nostalgia and zero actual time travel.
